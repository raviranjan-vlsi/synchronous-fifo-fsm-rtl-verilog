# 🚀 Overview

This project implements a **Parameterized Synchronous FIFO (First-In First-Out)** buffer using **Verilog HDL**.

The FIFO is designed for **single clock domain operation**, where both read and write operations are controlled using the same clock signal.

The design supports:

✔ Configurable FIFO depth  
✔ Configurable data width  
✔ Full and Empty flag generation  
✔ Simultaneous read/write operations  
✔ Efficient memory management  
✔ RTL-based scalable architecture  

The project demonstrates a reusable FIFO architecture suitable for:

- Digital systems
- SoC designs
- Communication interfaces
- FPGA-based systems

# 🎯 Key Features

✅ Single clock operation  
✅ Parameterized FIFO architecture  
✅ Full flag generation  
✅ Empty flag generation  
✅ Read and write pointer logic  
✅ FIFO memory array  
✅ Overflow and underflow protection  
✅ Synthesizable RTL design

# 🧠 FIFO Concept

A **FIFO (First-In First-Out)** is a memory structure where:

- The **first data written** is the **first data read**
- Data is stored sequentially
- Read and write operations use pointer management

### FIFO Operation

```text
Write → FIFO Memory → Read
```

# 🏗 System Architecture

</p>

The synchronous FIFO contains:

- FIFO Memory
- Write Pointer Logic
- Read Pointer Logic
- Full Detection Logic
- Empty Detection Logic
- Control Logic

---

# ⚙ Core Components

## 📝 Write Pointer Logic

The write pointer tracks the location where new data will be written.

Features:

- Incremented during write operation
- Stops incrementing when FIFO is FULL
- Prevents overflow condition

## 📖 Read Pointer Logic

The read pointer tracks the location from where data will be read.

Features:

- Incremented during read operation
- Stops incrementing when FIFO is EMPTY
- Prevents underflow condition

## 💾 FIFO Memory

The FIFO memory stores incoming data sequentially.

```verilog
reg [WIDTH-1:0] fifo [0:DEPTH-1];
```

Features:

✔ Parameterized memory depth  
✔ Efficient storage mechanism  
✔ Synthesizable design  

---

# 📊 Full and Empty Flag Logic

## 🚫 Full Condition

FIFO becomes FULL when:

```text
(write_pointer + 1) == read_pointer
```

</p>

---

## 📭 Empty Condition

FIFO becomes EMPTY when:

```text
write_pointer == read_pointer
```

# 🧪 Simulation Results

The design was verified using a Verilog testbench.

### Simulation Waveform

        wr_ptr <= wr_ptr + 1;
    end
end

always @(posedge clk)
begin
    if(rd_en && !empty)
    begin
        data_out <= fifo[rd_ptr];
        rd_ptr <= rd_ptr + 1;
    end
end
```
